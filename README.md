* In order to buy and sell assets, one must have metamask account. 
* You can ask us for free ETH or you will need to pay ETH on the platform in order to have a demo of the items.
* You can still view items **without having ETH**.

# Tagline

Open Store is a NFT marketplace where traders can buy and sell NFT tokens through the usage of ethers and track the ownership of digital assets.

# Problem it Solves

* **Duplicate Asset Problem**: Duplication of digital assets is not possible due to non fungibility of NFT's.

* **No Tampering of Data**: No one can easily tamper the data as the data is stored on the blockchain. 

* **Quick Transactions from Polygon**: Polygon provided us with *quick transaction speed* which boosted the *User Experience* of our website.

* **Ownership Record Maintainance**: Ownership can be tracked easily as smart contract passes the ownership from the seller to buyer directly.

* **Data Storage problem of Blockchain**: Blockchain can't be used for storing media files for media assets in an efficient manner, so we used IPFS for digital assets. 

# Challenges Faced

* **Learning New Technologies**: The entire team was unaware of the development technology behind NFT tokens. Consequently, the most difficult thing for us was to overcome the fear of learning a new technology such as blockchain. Thanks to **Polygon**, we were easily able to build NFT tokens. 
* **Integrating errors**: The integration of next.js backend and blockchain was one the challenges we faced.
* **CSS errors** : We invested a lot of time in developing the front end from scratch.
* **Technical Errors**: Many **Errors** while using blockchain emerged when we tried to merge the next.js with our backend.
* **Deploying error**:  Deploying was also one the challenges which we faced while building this project.
